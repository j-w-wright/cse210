Overview:
1. What does the program do?
    * Makes the setting and completing of goals into a game.  User gets points for completing three types of goals.  
    a. Simple goals - these are the "typical" goals.  An example would be running a 5K.
    b. Eternal goals - these are goals that are "neverending" and tend to relate to spiritual things.  An example of this might be to read the scriptures.
    c. Checklist goals - these are goals that have multiple instances before they are completed.  An example of these might be to attend the temple twice in the month.
    * For each goal completed or done (i.e., Eternal goal) the user gets points.  For completion of the checklist goals the user would also get a bonus. 
    * Displays the user score.
    * Indicate whether the goals are completed.
2. What user inputs does it have?
    a. Select what they want to do.  Add a goal, List goals, Save goals, Load goals, Record an event, Quit
    b. Add a goal - enter goal name, goal description (short), type of goal (e.g., Simple, Eternal), number of points
    Type of goal is from a menu.  "The types of goals are: 1., 2., 3. What type of goal would you like to create?"
    For checklist goal - how many times would you like to do the goal to consider it accomplished?
    c. For saving and loading a goal - .txt file
3. What output does it produce?
    a. list of goals and whether they are completed
    b. points earned from completing goals
    c. printing the goals to the file.

What is abstraction and why is it important?
Your response must:

1. Explain the meaning of Abstraction.
2. Highlight a benefit of Abstraction.
3. Provide an application of Abstraction.
4. Use a code example of Abstraction from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)

RESPONSE
Explanation:
    Abstraction is focusing on/displaying the relevant details and hiding the irrelevant implementation details.  The example in the lesson about the print function - programmers can use the print function within their code without seeing and knowing the thousands of lines of code within that function.

Benefit:
    This can help those who are using the abstracted code.  This could be programmers and/or users.  An analogy I heard online is that someone who is learning to drive a car, is shown the steering wheel, gas pedal, brake, and shifting.

Application:
    The code of within the program is an abstraction of the Resume code.

//RESUME code:
        public string _FirstName;
        public string _LastName;
        public List<Job> _Jobs = new List<Job>();
        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Name: {_FirstName} {_LastName}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Jobs: ");
            foreach (Job job in _Jobs)
        }
        {
            job.Display();
        } 

//PROGRAM code:
        Resume resume = new Resume();
        resume._FirstName = "Ned";
        resume._LastName = "Schnebley";

        resume._Jobs.Add(job1);
        resume._Jobs.Add(job2);

        resume.Display();

Encapsulation Explanation

1. Meaning:  Containing the variables and methods within a class, so that the access is controlled within that class.  Get and Set methods can be included within the class to access the restricted "private" data and behaviors.

2. Benefits:  The code that is encapsulated acts as one unit which is protected and hidden from outside access and how it is implemented.  It is easier to use as a unit in other areas of code.

3. Application:

example from Interview Happy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWt-mm5k258

public class Employee
{
    private int employeeExp;


    
    public int employeeExp - this is used to access the private employeeExp data.
    {
        get { return employeeExp; }

        set { employeeExp = value; }
    }
}
